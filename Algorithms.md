Deque, CircularBuffer, CircularDeque, Stack, Queue, Accumulators and Counters (i.e. Multisets / Bags), Disjoint Sets, Binary Heap, Mutable Binary Heap, Ordered Dicts and Sets, Dictionaries with Defaults, Trie, Linked List and Mutable Linked List, Sorted Dict, Sorted Multi-Dict and Sorted Set, DataStructures.IntSet, Priority Queue, Fenwick Tree

### Association Rule
+ [ARules.jl](https://github.com/toddleo/ARules.jl) :: Julia package for Association Rule Learning algorithms.

### Checksum 
+ [CRC.jl](https://github.com/andrewcooke/CRC.jl) :: This is a Julia module for calculating Cyclic Redundancy Checksums (CRCs).

### Collaborative Filtering
+ [RecSys.jl](https://github.com/abhijithch/RecSys.jl) :: An implementation of the algorithm from Yunhong Zhou, Dennis Wilkinson, Robert Schreiber and Rong Pan. Large-Scale Parallel Collaborative Filtering for the Netflix Prize. Proceedings of the 4th international conference on Algorithmic Aspects in Information and Management. Shanghai, China pp. 337-348, 2008.

### [Graph Algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Graph_algorithms)
